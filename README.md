# [5 Bucket Calculator](https://mariamar95.github.io/jan-hackathon/)

The [Bucket Calculator](https://mariamar95.github.io/jan-hackathon/) App is based on Dan Lok’s 5 [Bucket Money Management Concept]( https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-manage-money-5b490e9d3d63). 

His concept was designed to teach the user the habit of managing money as a long term solution. This is done by breaking the salary into 5 different buckets; Expenses, Emergency, Investment, Learning and Fun. The suggestion is to commit 60% of our salary to the Expenses bucket and 10% in each of the others. However, these percentages can be adjusted to suit bigger and smaller salaries.

Whilst sharing ideas and starting to brainstorm, we tried to take into consideration the skills and strengths of each team member and work on a project where everyone can get involved. We decided to build a front-end app which meant the majority of the team could contribute.

Using Dan Lok’s concept we built a calculator where the user could find out how much money would go in each bucket based on their salary.

We decided to the it a bit further and create a "Buckets Breakdown" calculator where the user can have a better tracking of their expenses. Once the user fills the form a chart will appear and the user can compare how their salary is distributed in the 5 buckets compared to Dan Lok's concept.

### User Stories
#### Primary Goals:
- To be able to use the site on different screen sizes (responsiveness).
- To see an easy to read breakdown of my spending (chart.JS)

- I want to see a comparison of my spending / saving compared to the recommendations (5 Bucket Principle).

#### Tertiary Goals:
- I want to be able to save the charts to view later (download as PDF).
- I want to be able to use this site in a range of countries (currency converter API)
- I want to be able to access guides on saving and spending less.
