# [Project name](deployed link)

*Insert Project Name*, based on Dan Lok's [5 Bucket Money Management Concept](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/how-to-manage-money-5b490e9d3d63), is a finance calculator that displays a breakdown of annual spending.

Dan Lok's concept was designed to teach the user the habit of managing money as a long term solution. This is done by breaking our salaries into 5 different buckets; Expenses, Emergency, Investment, Learning and Fun. The suggestion is to commit 60% of our salary to the Expenses bucket and 10% in each of the others. However, these percentages can be adjusted to suit bigger and smaller salaries.

Users need to enter their income, select their percentage ratio and the finance calculator displays the amount of money to put in to each bucket.

## UX

---

### User Stories
#### Primary Goals:
- To be able to use the site on different screen sizes (responsiveness).
- To see an easy to read breakdown of my spending (chart.JS)
- To use an accessible site that accounts for all users (colour-blindness, screen readers).

#### Secondary Goals:
- I want to be able to customise the label names on the charts.
- I want to see a comparison of my spending / saving compared to the recommendations (5 bucket principal).

#### Tertiary Goals:
- I want to be able to save the charts to view later (download as PDF).
- I want to be able to use this site in a range of countries (currency converter API)
- I want to be able to access guides on saving and spending less.
